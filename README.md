# Not So Basic CAD
## A Little Practice
Description:In this assignment I used solidworks tutorials to create a pressure plate and an assembly of a block. 

Lessons Learned: First off, while somewhat tedious solidworks tutorials are very useful as they go step by step. Secondly, patterns are your friend, never try to replicate a shape or cut when you cold pattern.

## Sweeps and Lofts
Description: In this assignment I used to tutorials to create a hammerhead which used the loft and flex feature. I also created a candle holder which involved revolves and sweeps.  

Lessons Learned: While the cut is not pictured, lofted cuts are really helpful on this sort of tool. I also learned it can be really helpful to have multiple planes.
